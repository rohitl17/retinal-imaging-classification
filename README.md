Classifying the images for their quality to keep the disease prediction model performance intact.

Fundus photography involves photographing the rear of an eye, also known as the fundus. Specialized fundus cameras consisting of an intricate microscope attached to a flash enabled camera are used in fundus photography. The main structures that can be visualized on a fundus photo are the central and peripheral retina, optic disc and macula. Fundus photography can be performed with colored filters, or with specialized dyes including fluorescein and indocyanine green.

Our model tries to predict the quality of the image, so that only good images are passed to the rest of the prediction models in the pipeline. This helps keep the performance intact. Another goal of this project is to walkthrough the end-to-end model building pipeline.
